# Euler-Rust
My [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) track in Rust. Every solution is commented, and some problems feature multiple solutions.

## Compiling and Running
This project uses `Cargo`. With `rust` installed on your machine, you can execute my code with:
```
cargo run
```

The main program then asks for a Problem number to run, which you can enter in the command line:
```
$ cargo run
    Compiling ...
     Finished ...
      Running ...
Problem number:
1
```

Alternatively, you can directly pass the problem number as an environment argument:
```
$ cargo run 1
    Compiling ...
     Finished ...
      Running ...
Problem 1 solution: ...
```
